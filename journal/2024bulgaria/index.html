        <h2 id="2024bulgaria" style="color: blue"> 保加利亚布拉戈耶夫格勒“公款旅游”记 <br> A trip to Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria with expenses covered </h3>
        <p>2024 年 8 月 5 日至 11 日，站长参加了举办地位于保加利亚布拉戈耶夫格勒的保加利亚美利坚大学 (AUBG) 的第 31 届国际大学生数学竞赛，但仅仅获得三等奖。更大的收获来自于竞赛前密集的训练，既是对手又是朋友的全球人才，以及在小镇上漫无目的闲逛时的惊喜——毕竟，机票钱和比赛费用都报销。</p>
        <p>From 5 to 11 August 2024, the operator participated in the 31st International Mathematics Competition for University Students hosted in American University of Bulgaria (AUBG) in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. Only Third Prize was obtained. The operator had benefited more from the preparation before the competition, those elites from all over the world, and some of the unexpected when wandering on the streets of the small but lovely city: after all, the expenses of flight tickets and competition fees were all covered by somebody else.</p>
        <h3 id="2024bulgaria-1" style="color: orange">一 抵达<br>I. Arrival</h3>
        <p>2024 年 8 月 4 日上午 11 时许，站长收拾好了全部的行李，打车前往宁波火车站：这是与宁波诺丁汉大学 (UNNC) 的永别，因为 9 月开学时站长将前往英国诺丁汉大学进行剩余两年的本科学习。12 时 10 分左右到达火车站，吃饭后不久即开始检票，连在候车大厅内的三角钢琴上最后弹一首 <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE411P7k6/">Alla Figaro</a> 的时间都没有。</p>
        <p>At around 11 AM on 4th August 2024, the operator packed all the baggage and rode a taxi to Ningbo Railway Station, which is a farewell to the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), since the operator will go to the University of Nottingham, UK campus to continue the remaining two years of undergraduate study in September. Railway Station was reached at around 12:10 PM, and the ticket check began too soon after lunch to play <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE411P7k6/">Alla Figaro</a> on the piano in the departure hall for the last time.</p>
        <p>2024-08-04 G7514 (CRH380BL) <br> 1319 宁波 Ningbo -- Shanghai Hongqiao 上海虹桥 1517 <br> 二等座 Second Class CNY 144</p>
        <p>抵达上海虹桥火车站后要乘坐接近两个小时的上海地铁 2 号线前往浦东机场。站长并未一次性乘坐全程，而是在世纪大道（该站距离虹桥火车站与浦东国际机场均为 14 站）的商场内吃晚饭后继续乘坐剩余部分。并未使用磁悬浮列车，由于时间不紧张，车票太贵，且 2023 年 9 月已经以观光性质乘坐过了。</p>
        <p>Once arriving at Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, nearly two hours of Shanghai Metro Line 2 train has to be ridden to go to Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG). The operator did not ride it as a whole, but took the remaining part after exiting at Century Avenue (which is 14 stations far from both Hongqiao Railway Station and PVG) for dinner in the mall nearby. The operator did not use the maglev train, since there was plenty of time and experience of riding it as tourism in September 2023, and the ticket price is too expensive. </p>
        <p>约晚 7 时抵达上海浦东国际机场。带队教师与队员也于晚 8 时前悉数抵达。接下来就是候机了。候机过程中，大家讨论了一则数学问题：如何证明可逆矩阵的左逆等于右逆？</p>
        <p>The operator arrived at PVG Airport at around 7 PM, and all team members and the team leader reached there by 8 PM. A math problem was discussed during waiting for the departure: how to prove the left-inverse of a invertible matrix equals its right-inverse?</p>

        <p>卡塔尔航空的航班服务质量很好，唯一的问题是只提供一个小时的免费无线网络。飞机餐和饮料绝佳，此时大家还不知道这是整段旅程中“最好”的饭。</p>
        <p>The flights by Qatar Airways generally have a great quality of service, the only drawback was only one hour of free Wi-Fi was provided. The flight meals and drinks were excellent, but all team members didn't know these could be the "best" meals (for Chinese tastes) during the whole trip.</p>
        <p>早点抵达极尽奢华的卡塔尔多哈机场，里面物价极高。幸好由于转机时间较短，并未在内就餐，但购买了一根 Mars 巧克力棒，非常甜。</p>
        <p>We arrived at the top-luxurious Doha International Airport, Qatar earlier than scheduled. Everything is expensive there. Fortunately we didn't have meals there because of short transfer time. The operator purchased a Mars chocolate bar -- it was very sweet.</p>
        <p>三个小时之后，我们又乘着摆渡车离开了多哈机场。接下来的飞机没有点播屏，甚至没有插头！</p>
        <p>We took a shuttle bus again and left Doha Airport three hours later. The following plane has no multimedia screen, even no place to charge!</p>

        <p>不管怎样，我们安全到达了索非亚机场。到达层有穿着 IMC 工作服的人热情欢迎我们，并告知我们预订的去往布拉戈耶夫格勒的巴士将于下午 2 时 30 分出发。</p>
        <p>Anyway, we arrived at Sofia Airport safely. There were persons with IMC T-shirts welcoming us in the arrival hall, telling us the bus to Blagoevgrad as we booked would depart at 2:30 PM.</p>
        <p>巴士实际于下午 2 时 40 分出发，于下午 4 时 20 分抵达布拉戈耶夫格勒的保加利亚美利坚大学 (AUBG)，用时 100 分钟。在等巴士的过程中，我们与一位瑞典参赛者交流了不少。巴士则是清一色的 Setra 品牌。</p>
        <p>The bus actually departed at 2:40 PM, and reached American University in Bulgaria (AUBG) in Blagoevgrad at 4:20 PM. The journey was 100 minutes. We talked a lot with a Swedish participant when waiting for the bus. The buses were all Setra.</p>
        <p>天真蓝啊！</p>
        <p>How blue and clear the sky was!</p>
