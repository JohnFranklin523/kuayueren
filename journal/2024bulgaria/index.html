        <h2 id="2024bulgaria" style="color: blue"> 保加利亚布拉戈耶夫格勒“公款旅游”记 <br> A trip to Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria with expenses covered </h3>
        <p>2024 年 8 月 5 日至 11 日，站长参加了举办地位于保加利亚布拉戈耶夫格勒的保加利亚美利坚大学 (AUBG) 的第 31 届国际大学生数学竞赛，但仅仅获得三等奖。更大的收获来自于竞赛前密集的训练，既是对手又是朋友的全球人才，以及在小镇上漫无目的闲逛时的惊喜——毕竟，机票钱和比赛费用都报销。</p>
        <p>From 5 to 11 August 2024, the operator participated in the 31st International Mathematics Competition for University Students hosted in American University of Bulgaria (AUBG) in Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria. Only Third Prize was obtained. The operator had benefited more from the preparation before the competition, those elites from all over the world, and some of the unexpected when wandering on the streets of the small but lovely city: after all, the expenses of flight tickets and competition fees were all covered by somebody else.</p>
        <h3 id="2024bulgaria" style="color: orange">第一天：8 月 4-5 日<br>Day I. 4-5th August</h3>
        <p>2024 年 8 月 4 日上午 11 时许，站长收拾好了全部的行李，打车前往宁波火车站：这是与宁波诺丁汉大学 (UNNC) 的永别，因为 9 月开学时站长将前往英国诺丁汉大学进行剩余两年的本科学习。12 时 10 分左右到达火车站，吃饭后不久即开始检票，连在候车大厅内的三角钢琴上最后弹一首 <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE411P7k6/">Alla Figaro</a> 的时间都没有。</p>
        <p>At around 11 AM on 4th August 2024, the operator packed all the baggage and rode a taxi to Ningbo Railway Station, which is a farewell to the University of Nottingham Ningbo China (UNNC), since the operator will go to the University of Nottingham, UK campus to continue the remaining two years of undergraduate study in September. Railway Station was reached at around 12:10 PM, and the ticket check began too soon after lunch to play <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nE411P7k6/">Alla Figaro</a> on the piano in the departure hall for the last time.</p>
        <p>2024-08-04 G7514 (CRH380BL) <br> 1319 宁波 Ningbo -- Shanghai Hongqiao 上海虹桥 1517 <br> 二等座 Second Class CNY 144</p>
        <p>抵达上海虹桥火车站后要乘坐接近两个小时的上海地铁 2 号线前往浦东机场。站长并未一次性乘坐全程，而是在世纪大道（该站距离虹桥火车站与浦东国际机场均为 14 站）的商场内吃晚饭后继续乘坐剩余部分。并未使用磁悬浮列车，由于时间不紧张，车票太贵，且 2023 年 9 月已经以观光性质乘坐过了。</p>
        <p>Once arriving at Shanghai Hongqiao Railway Station, nearly two hours of Shanghai Metro Line 2 train has to be ridden to go to Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG). The operator did not ride it as a whole, but took the remaining part after exiting at Century Avenue (which is 14 stations far from both Hongqiao Railway Station and PVG) for dinner in the mall nearby. The operator did not use the maglev train, since there was plenty of time and experience of riding it as tourism in September 2023, and the ticket price is too expensive. </p>
        <p>约晚 7 时抵达上海浦东国际机场。带队教师与队员也于晚 8 时前悉数抵达。接下来就是候机了。候机过程中，大家讨论了一则数学问题：如何证明可逆矩阵的左逆等于右逆？</p>
        <p>The operator arrived at PVG Airport at around 7 PM, and all team members and the team leader reached there by 8 PM. A math problem was discussed during waiting for the departure: how to prove the left-inverse of a invertible matrix equals its right-inverse?</p>

        <p>卡塔尔航空的航班服务质量很好，唯一的问题是只提供一个小时的免费无线网络。飞机餐和饮料绝佳，此时大家还不知道这是整段旅程中“最好”的饭。</p>
        <p>The flights by Qatar Airways generally have a great quality of service, the only drawback was only one hour of free Wi-Fi was provided. The flight meals and drinks were excellent, but all team members didn't know these could be the "best" meals (for Chinese tastes) during the whole trip.</p>
        <p>早点抵达极尽奢华的卡塔尔多哈机场，里面物价极高。幸好由于转机时间较短，并未在内就餐，但购买了一根 Mars 巧克力棒，非常甜。</p>
        <p>We arrived at the top-luxurious Doha International Airport, Qatar earlier than scheduled. Everything is expensive there. Fortunately we didn't have meals there because of short transfer time. The operator purchased a Mars chocolate bar -- it was very sweet.</p>
        <p>三个小时之后，我们又乘着摆渡车离开了多哈机场。接下来的飞机没有点播屏，甚至没有插头！</p>
        <p>We took a shuttle bus again and left Doha Airport three hours later. The following plane has no multimedia screen, even no place to charge!</p>

        </div>
        <p>不管怎样，我们安全到达了索非亚机场。到达层有穿着 IMC 工作服的人热情欢迎我们，并告知我们预订的去往布拉戈耶夫格勒的巴士将于下午 2 时 30 分出发。</p>
        <p>Anyway, we arrived at Sofia Airport safely. There were persons with IMC T-shirts welcoming us in the arrival hall, telling us the bus to Blagoevgrad as we booked would depart at 2:30 PM.</p>
        <p>巴士实际于下午 2 时 40 分出发，于下午 4 时 20 分抵达布拉戈耶夫格勒的保加利亚美利坚大学 (AUBG) 的生活区 Skaptopara，用时 100 分钟。在等巴士的过程中，我们与一位瑞典参赛者交流了不少。巴士则是清一色的 Setra 品牌。</p>
        <p>The bus actually departed at 2:40 PM, and reached the living area, named Skaptopara, of American University in Bulgaria (AUBG) in Blagoevgrad at 4:20 PM. The journey was 100 minutes. We talked a lot with a Swedish participant when waiting for the bus. The buses were all Setra.</p>

        </div>
        <p>到达之后就是排队领名片、分宿舍的过程。站长和一位同校队员住在一起。两人间的面积很大，但唯一的也是最大的缺点就是没有空调。放完行李后，我们又去了一楼，墙上张贴着很多公告，说明本次竞赛的时间和考场安排。Skaptopara 只是生活区，考场在离宿舍一公里的教学区！</p>
        <p>Once upon arrival, we waited in a long queue to take name card and for dormitory arrangement. The operator shared a room with a team member from the same university. Despite the huge space of the twin room, it has no air conditioner. After unpacking the luggage, we went to the ground floor again. There were many pieces of notice on the wall, mainly about time and exam venue arrangements. Skaptopara is only a living area. The exam venue is in the teaching building one kilometer away!</p>

        </div>
        <p>生活区有两幢宿舍楼，分别为 Skaptopara I 和 Skaptopara II；由于参赛者太多，带队老师们被安排到了生活区外的旅馆（有空调！）。还有一个图书馆，但是不开放；一个学生活动中心，有自习区域、咖啡厅、纪念品商店、室内运动场，二楼张贴着东欧各国社会主义时期的宣传画，还有一张毛主席语录。食堂位于活动中心三楼。活动中心南面也有室外体育场。</p>
        <p>There are two dormitory buildings in the Living Area, namely Skaptopara I and Skaptopara II. The team leaders were all arranged to a hotel (with air conditioners!) outside of the Skaptoparas since there were too many participants. There is also a library, but closed; a student center, with self-study areas, a cafe, a souvenir shop, and an indoor playground. There are posters from communist periods of Eastern Europe on the wall, including a piece of saying from Mao. The canteen is on the top floor. There are also outdoor sport facilities southward in front of the student center.</p>
        <p>大体熟悉地势后，晚饭开始了。不报太多期待的话，还是比较好吃的，没有网传“白人饭对中国胃”那样接受不了。因为保加利亚实行夏令时，天黑得特别晚，要到晚上九点以后，所以晚饭也至少要从晚上七点半开始。</p>
        <p>The dinner started after we were familiar with the geography of Skaptopara. It was acceptable for Chinese stomachs, and even tasted good, if your expectation was not too high. Due to the 1-hour summer time shift (Energy Saving Time), it went dark very late, and it was still bright at 9 PM; thus the dinner was also no earlier than 7:30 PM.</p>

        </div>
        <p>晚饭后大家去了生活区南面的超市 Kaufland。酸奶、汽水、巧克力都非常便宜：一大杯（400 克）酸奶有的不到 1 LV（约合人民币 4 元或 0.5 欧元），虽然不添加任何糖分，酸到难以下咽；一大瓶汽水（2 升）有的只有 1.5 LV，比瓶装水都便宜。但即使汽水比纯净水便宜，观察下来的肥胖率也不高。</p>
        <p>We went to a supermarket named Kaufland southward to Skaptopara after dinner. The yoghurt, fizzy drinks, and chocolate were very cheap: the price of a big cup (400 g) of yoghurt could be lower than 1 LV (~CNY 4, EUR 0.5). However, it didn't consist any additional sugar and was extremely sour and extremely hard to drink directly. And a large bottle (2 L) of cola could be as cheap as 1.5 LV, even cheaper than bottled water. Despite this, the obesity rate of that city was observed not high.</p>
        <p>Kaufland 晚上九点关门，我们几乎待到最后一刻；在扔掉实在喝不下去的酸奶后，我们回到了宿舍休息。</p>
        <p>Kaufland closes at 9 PM, not until nearly which we did leave. After dropping the awfully unacceptable yoghurt into the bin, we were all back to dormitory to rest.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>热，热啊！洗完澡后，还是不停地出汗。虽然晚上室外并不热（每日最低气温一般低于 20 摄氏度），但白天剧烈的阳光、苏系房屋的保温效果以及较低的通风率使得入睡成为每天最难熬的时段。虽然如此，由于向西倒时差，相对提前的生物钟还是使我晚上不到 11 点就进入梦乡。</p>
        <p>HOT! VERY HOT! Sweating continued even after bath. It was cool outside after sunset (the lowest temperature of the day was generally lower than 20 degree Celsius), but the sharp sunlight during the day, the heat-keeping feature of Soviet-style buildings, and the low air change rate, all together made it the hardest time of the day to fall asleep. However, since it is going westward from China to Bulgaria, the jet lag had made the biological clock relatively earlier, and thus I still fell asleep before 11 PM.</p>
        <h3 id="2024bulgaria" style="color: orange">第二天：8 月 6 日<br>Day II. 6th August</h3>
        <p>早上不到 7 点就醒了。需要保持这种早睡早起的生物钟，因为考试日需要起得更早。早饭于 7 时 30 分开始提供：一块黄色奶酪，一块白色奶酪，一片火腿，一包黄油，一盒果酱，一段黄瓜，一块西红柿，面包、奶制品、麦片自取。面包有三种：普通的白面包、牛角包、填充咸奶酪的油条状酥皮面点。奶制品则有普通牛奶、植物基奶以及与昨晚味道相似的酸奶（但提供白砂糖）。麦片有玉米片、燕麦片、巧克力球。提供热的浓咖啡，可加奶，但纸杯容量很小，完全稀释不到 Caffe Latte 的水平，也不可加冰。但其实 Espresso 也不是苦到接受不了，适应其浓度及提神效果之后，回国甚至会精神不振。之后的每顿早餐都是这样。</p>
        <p>Woke up before 7. Such early routine should be kept since we need to get up earlier on exam days. Breakfast started at 7:30 AM, with a piece of yellow cheese, a piece of white cheese, a piece of ham, a box of butter, a box of jam, a piece of cucumber, and a piece of tomato. Bread, dairy products and cereals are also provided. There are three type of bread: normal toast, crossiant, and a kind of long-shaped bread with salty cheese toppings and oil crisps. Dairy includes normal milk, plant-based milk for vegan options, and yoghurt with taste as yesterday (but sugar is provided). Cereals include corn and oak flakes, and cocoa crisp balls. There is hot coffee with optional milk, but the small paper cup makes it impossible to add as much milk as Caffe Latte. However, espresso is not too bitter to accept. Once adapted to its thickness and refreshing effects, it is likely to feel sleepy without it. The breakfast kept the same for the following days.</p>
        <p>吃完早饭后过了几个小时，我们跟随着带队老师去了考场，以熟悉考试地点。从生活区到考场有不同的路径，老师指引的走法并非最短，但是最容易记住：我一般记为“左右左左”，即在生活区最北端先左转进入主路，走到尽头的丁字路口右转后不久进入铺砌石砖的步行区（这是该市最繁华的商业街），走到左边有多层商场、前面有酒吧、直行的路变窄的路口时左转，再走到一个不规则路口（类似于纽约时代广场）时转向左前方，即可看到 AUBG 的教学楼。观察了一下，考场内有空调！</p>
        <p>Hours after breakfast, we were led by the team leader to the exam venue, to familiarise the route. There are different routes, and the team leader did not choose the shortest one, but the easiest one to memorise. I recite it as "Left, Right, Left, Left", which is to turn left first to enter into the main road at the northernmost of Skaptopara, turn right once reaching the T-junction at the end, a while after which a pedestrian zone with stone pavements should be entered (which is the most lively area of the city), and to turn left at a junction with a mall on the left, and bars and narrower path on the front, and finally turn to the left-front to see the building of AUBG at a irregular junction shaped like Time's Square in New York City. Fortunately, there are air conditioners at exam venues!</p>

        </div>
        <p>我们原路返回了生活区（大约需要 20 分钟），发现午饭全是素食。吃完午饭后，带队老师与我们告别，因为他要参与命题及试题讨论，要忙到很晚。即使有时间再见面，出于保密原则，考试结束前也不能讨论任何数学问题。临走前，老师给了我们好成绩的祝愿，但同时也说：放轻松，最重要的是享受考试的过程。老师们都看到了大家准备的努力与积极性，这比最终的成绩更重要。即使考零分也没有关系，关于墓地的话只是玩笑！</p>
        <p>Same route back to Skaptopara (approximately 20 minutes), we found the lunch was all vegetarian. The team leader said goodbye to us after lunch, since he should participate in the assignment and discussion of exam problems. Even if meeting again before the exam ended, any mathematical problems should not be discussed due to secure principle. Although the team leader wished everyone a good result, he also said, take it easy, and enjoy the exams first. We have all seen your time and effort spent on the preparation, and you are happy about it, which is the most important instead of the results. You don't need to worry, even if you got zero. Any word about those graves is only a joke.</p>
        <p>即便明天就要考试，我仍然拾起了我的铁道考察的老本行。在抵达当天，我就发现生活区的南边有一条铁路。下午两点钟，我一边向南走着，一边在保加利亚铁路 (BDZ) <a href="https://bdz.bg">官网</a>上查看布拉戈耶夫格勒火车站的时刻表，发现 14 时 20 分有一班车要驶离布拉戈耶夫格勒前往索非亚。然而离生活区最近的铁道路口在布拉戈耶夫格勒——索非亚区间之外，因此想要拍车，还须向西近 1 公里前往布拉戈耶夫格勒火车站。</p>
        <p>Despite the exam tomorrow, I picked up my hobby of railway exploration. On the day of arrival, I had found there is a railway southward to Skaptopara. Thus at around 2 PM, I checked the timetable of Blagoevgrad Railway Station on the <a href="https://bdz.bg">official website</a> of Bulgaria Railway (BDZ) while walking toward the south, and found there is a train to depart at 1420 from Blagoevgrad to Sofia. However, the nearest railway crossing is not in the section from Blagoevgrad to Sofia, and thus I should walk nearly 1 kilometer west to go to Blagoevgrad Railway Station to go trainspotting.</p>
        <p>我及时到了火车站：车站用中国标准来看极其简陋，没有室内的候车大厅，也没有跨站台的天桥，站台和雨棚也年代久远。靠近车站建筑的站台的墙边有一台自动咖啡机，除了售卖价格更贵以外和宿舍一楼公共区域的咖啡机一模一样：供应三种咖啡豆的小杯热咖啡、热牛奶和热巧克力，可选加糖量。宿舍一楼的咖啡售卖价格在 0.60 至 1.20 LV 不等，即使按火车站的价格，甚至也便宜过国内的瓶装咖啡。</p>
        <p>I reached the railway station in time. That is a very rugged station if using standards of China: no indoor departure hall, no bridge for passengers crossing rail tracks, and the platforms together with roof are very old. There is a coffee vending machine on the wall of the platform nearby the station building exactly the same as the machine on the ground floor of the Skaptopara II Hall, except higher prices. The machine sells hot milk, chocolate, and coffee with options of three types of coffee beans, with adjustable sugar amount. The prices at the dormitory hall range from 0.60 to 1.20 LV, and even at the railway station, the coffee is cheaper than most bottled coffee in China.</p>

        <p>地区列车 REG 50112 于 14 时 20 分发车，将于 17 时 05 分到达索非亚，中间停靠 30 站，用时 2 小时 45 分钟，比抵达时的大巴要慢一个小时。可能地区列车需要照顾沿线小站的客流，但即使是最快的车也需要 2 小时 5 分钟（ICF 5612，中间只停靠 4 站），仍然没有对公路客运的足够竞争力。</p>
        <p>The regional train REG 50112 departs at 1420, and is scheduled to reach Sofia at 1705, via-stopping at 30 stations. The whole journey would take 2 hours and 45 minutes, one hour slower than the coach on the day of arrival. This may because it should attract passengers at intermediate stations as a regional train, but even the fastest train would cost 2 hours and 5 minutes (ICF 5612, only via-stopping 4 stations), whose power is thus not enough to compete with road transport.</p>
